# Jupyter Notebooks for "Machine Learning for Drug Discovery"

This repository contains code and data for the first edition of Machine Learning for Drug Discovery (Manning Publications). The companion material within this repository covers introductory topics at the intersection of machine learning, deep learning, and drug discovery applied to real world scenarios in each chapter. The code and notebooks are released under the Apache 2.0 license. 

The first edition is a work in progress and notebooks will be released as they are drafted. We anticipate a full release of the book in Fall 2024. In the meantime, chapters will be released and made available as part of Manning's Early Access Program in early 2024. We recommend interacting with notebooks through Colab.
