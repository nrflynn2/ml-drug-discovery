# "Machine Learning for Drug Discovery" - Code and Data Repository

### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Machine Learning for Drug Discovery Repository

This repository contains code and data for the first edition of [Machine Learning for Drug Discovery (Manning Publications)](http://mng.bz/DdVn). The companion material within this repository covers introductory topics at the intersection of machine learning, deep learning, and drug discovery applied to real world scenarios in each chapter. The code and notebooks are released under the Apache 2.0 license. 

For readability, the chapter notebooks only contain runnable code blocks and section titles. They omit the rest of the material in the book, i.e., text paragraphs, figures (unless generated as part of one of the code blocks), equations, and pseudocode. **If you want to be able to follow what's going on, I recommend reading the notebooks side-by-side with your copy of the book!**

### ðŸš§ Under Construction

Note that this project is a work in progress and notebooks will be released as they are drafted. We anticipate a full release of the book in Winter 2025. We recommend interacting with notebooks through Colab.

Purchase of the book through Manning's Early Access Program (MEAP) guarantees access to current and future chapters. I appreciate your patience and support!

Encounter any issues? Please let me know -- I can't fix a problem if I am not aware of its existence!

### ðŸ’» Getting Started

#### Option 1: Google Colab (No Installation Required)

Open the repository in Colab to walk through the notebooks without needing to install anything! <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/nrflynn2/ml-drug-discovery/blob/main/" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

#### Option 2: Local Installation

**Prerequisites**: Python 3.11+ and git

Choose one of the following installation methods:

**Quick Start with uv (Fastest)**

```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/nrflynn2/ml-drug-discovery.git
cd ml-drug-discovery
uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Complete Installation with Conda (Recommended for All Features)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nrflynn2/ml-drug-discovery.git
cd ml-drug-discovery
conda env create -f ml4dd2025.yml
conda activate ml4dd2025
```

**Traditional pip Installation**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nrflynn2/ml-drug-discovery.git
cd ml-drug-discovery
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For molecular dynamics tools (optional except for chapter 9):
# conda install -c conda-forge openmm pdbfixer vina
```

For detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
